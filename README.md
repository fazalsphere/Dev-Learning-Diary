# Dev Learning Diary 🧠💻

Welcome to my developer learning diary — a structured and consistent path to mastering **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and real-world front-end projects.

This repo documents my daily learning exercises, tutorials, quizzes, and mini-projects, categorized for clarity and growth tracking.

## 📁 Structure
- `HTML/` – All foundational HTML tutorials & quizzes.
- `CSS/` – CSS tutorials, Flex/Grid exercises, and visual layout mastery.
