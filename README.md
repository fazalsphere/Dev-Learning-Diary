# Dev-Learning-Diary

A structured and evolving collection of my practical front-end development journey. This repository documents everything I’m learning — from foundational HTML/CSS to advanced hands-on projects — organized in a modular way for clarity and growth.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Dev-Learning-Diary/
│
├── HTML/
│ └── Core concepts, exercises, and foundational markup practice

└── README.md


Each folder represents a focused phase of learning, with progressively more advanced implementations. The goal is not just note-taking but building a professional workflow and strong codebase through repetition, projects, and review.

## 🧠 Highlights

- Clean, semantic code practices
- Real-world mini-projects built from scratch
- Incremental improvement in code structure and design
- Git & GitHub used to track and reflect versioned learning

## 🛠️ How to Use

Whether you're reviewing your own work or exploring how structured self-learning can be organized, this repo serves as a simple model for consistent practice and version-controlled growth.
